    <h2>üè• Abbott Biowearables Strategy</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project is a case study on how Abbott‚Äôs biowearables ‚Äî particularly the FreeStyle Libre‚Ñ¢ portfolio, Lingo‚Ñ¢, and Libre Rio‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî are transforming diabetes management and overall health monitoring. It focuses on how these technologies create value by improving patient outcomes, enhancing patient experience, and lowering healthcare costs, while expanding the market for digital health solutions.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> PowerPoint, Excel, Canva</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> This case study demonstrates that Abbott‚Äôs continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) solutions ‚Äî FreeStyle Libre‚Ñ¢, Lingo‚Ñ¢, and Libre Rio‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî drive measurable healthcare impact by reducing hypoglycemia events by 43%, lowering HbA1c by 0.9%, cutting hospitalization rates by 66%, and saving up to $8,500 in annual healthcare costs per user. The findings support CGMs as critical tools for building a proactive, data-driven healthcare ecosystem beyond traditional diabetes management.</p>

  <div class="project" id="tinder">
    <h2>üìä Tinder: Dating App Dynamics</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> In this project, we explored gender dynamics on dating apps like Tinder to answer the question: Who's winning and losing in the Dating App Olympics? Using publicly available datasets, we analyzed metrics like match rates, like-to-match conversions, and relationship outcomes across genders. Statistical methods including hypothesis testing, Z-tests, and regression models were applied. Visualizations were created with Tableau to clearly illustrate key patterns and differences.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python (t-tests, ANOVA), Tableau</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Women had a much higher likes-to-match success rate (34.22%) compared to men (9.4%), a statistically significant difference showing greater selectivity and efficiency. Men slightly outperformed women in converting matches to dates (11.59% vs. 6.92%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, women were more successful at turning dates into relationships (11.42% vs. 5.33%), though again not at a significant level. Men were more likely to seek casual relationships, while women more often pursued serious ones. Finally, linking an Instagram account significantly improved match rates, while the number of profile pictures had little effect.</p>

    <h2>üìâ Netflix Pricing Strategy & Retention Plan</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Led a comprehensive marketing strategy project focused on reducing Netflix‚Äôs rising churn rate driven by frequent price increases and brand perception decline.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> SWOT, Evaluation Matrix, Pricing Frameworks, Strategic Planning</p>
    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Price sensitivity and value mismatch were core causes of churn. Customer perception shifted from ‚Äúpremium‚Äù to ‚Äúoverpriced.‚Äù</p>

  <div class="project" id="icecream">
    <h2>üç¶ Ice Cream Consumer Sentiment</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> In a world where indulgence meets data, we analyzed 21,000+ online ice cream reviews using NLP to decode which flavors spark joy ‚Äî and which leave a bad taste.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, TF-IDF, Sentiment Analysis, Random Forest Classifier</p>
    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Consumers crave indulgence ‚Äî caramel, chocolate, and almonds drove 5-star reviews, while artificial stabilizers triggered long, negative rants. Negative reviews were 2x longer on average, highlighting emotional dissatisfaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Achieved 81% accuracy in predicting top-performing flavors and built brand-specific visualizations to inform R&D and flavor launches.</p>
